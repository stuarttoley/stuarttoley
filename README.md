- I’m a Samoan/CookIsland/Kiwi Software Developer from New Zealand.

- I am a fully qualified pilot 👨‍✈️ and was flying overseas until the Covid pandemic hit and showed how things can change in an instant. Instead of waiting for an industy that may or may not return
I decided to upskill and start a new career in Software Developement.
